a = 10
b = 5

print(a + b) # a add b = 15
print(a - b) # a sub b = 5
print(a * b) # a mul b = 50
print(a / b) # a div b = 2
# Correct! the output:
# 15
# 5
# 50
# 2.0 (division always return float in python maybe)

# let some op // % and **
print(a // b) # ? I think it same like divison but a bit different, my guess = 2 (I don't have any idea for this op)
print(a % b) # Modulus is you can return remainder of division so = 0 because a / b not have remainder
print(a**b) # I don't have idea for this, maybe x * b *  2? if yeah it mean = 100

# Let's check the output:
# 15
# 5
# 50
# 2.0
# 2 < I'm correct but why? // dan / it's has same result, but why?
# 0 < I'm correct
# 100000 < okay this interesting, because different from my estimation
